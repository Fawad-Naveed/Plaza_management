# Plaza Management System - Authentication Implementation

This document outlines the authentication system that has been implemented for the plaza management system.

## Overview

The system now supports two types of users:
1. **Admin** - Has access to the full admin interface for managing all businesses
2. **Business** - Has access to a business-specific dashboard showing only their data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes

Run this SQL script to add authentication fields to your database:

```sql
-- File: scripts/003_add_auth_to_businesses.sql
ALTER TABLE businesses 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password_hash VARCHAR(255);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_businesses_username ON businesses(username);
```

### 2. Admin Credentials

**Default Admin Login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

⚠️ **Important:** Change the admin password in production by updating the `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` constant in `lib/auth.ts`.

### 3. New Components

1. **SigninPage** (`components/signin-page.tsx`)
   - Login form with username, password, and role selection
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Redirects based on user role

2. **BusinessDashboard** (`components/business-dashboard.tsx`)
   - Business-specific interface showing:
     - Business details
     - Bills and payment history
     - Overview statistics
   - Read-only access to business-specific data

3. **AppRouter** (`components/app-router.tsx`)
   - Main routing component that determines which interface to show
   - Handles authentication state management

4. **Updated BusinessManagementOptimized**
   - Now includes username and password fields when adding new businesses
   - Username uniqueness validation
   - Password hashing

### 4. Authentication Flow

#### For Admin:
1. Navigate to the signin page
2. Select "Admin" role
3. Enter admin credentials
4. Access full admin interface

#### For Business:
1. Navigate to the signin page
2. Select "Business" role  
3. Enter business username and password
4. Access business-specific dashboard

### 5. Adding New Businesses

When adding a new business through the admin interface:

1. Fill in all business details as usual
2. **New:** Enter a unique username (letters, numbers, underscores only)
3. **New:** Enter a password (minimum 6 characters)
4. The password will be automatically hashed before storage
5. Username uniqueness is validated against existing usernames and the admin username

### 6. Key Files Modified/Created

#### New Files:
- `lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities (login, password hashing, etc.)
- `components/signin-page.tsx` - Login interface
- `components/business-dashboard.tsx` - Business interface
- `components/app-router.tsx` - Main routing logic
- `scripts/003_add_auth_to_businesses.sql` - Database schema update

#### Modified Files:
- `lib/database.ts` - Updated Business interface to include username/password_hash
- `components/business-management-optimized.tsx` - Added username/password fields to the form

### 7. Usage Instructions

#### To integrate into your app:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs
   ```

2. **Run Database Migration:**
   Execute the SQL script in `scripts/003_add_auth_to_businesses.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

3. **Update Your Main App Component:**
   Replace your main app component with the `AppRouter`:
   
   ```tsx
   import { AppRouter } from "@/components/app-router"
   
   export default function App() {
     return <AppRouter />
   }
   ```

4. **Create Your First Business User:**
   - Login as admin (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
   - Add a new business with username and password
   - Test login with the new business credentials

### 8. Security Features

- ✅ Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 10
- ✅ Username uniqueness validation
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Session management via localStorage
- ✅ Form validation with error handling

### 9. Future Enhancements

Some potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Session Expiration:** Add token-based authentication with expiration
2. **Password Reset:** Implement password reset functionality
3. **User Management:** Allow admin to reset business passwords
4. **Multi-tenancy:** Allow businesses to have multiple users
5. **Audit Logging:** Track login attempts and actions

### 10. Testing the System

1. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Should see the full business management interface

2. **Create Test Business:**
   - Login as admin
   - Add a new business with username: `testbusiness` and password: `password123`

3. **Test Business Login:**
   - Logout from admin
   - Login with role: "Business", username: `testbusiness`, password: `password123`
   - Should see the business dashboard with only that business's data

### 11. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Username already exists" error:** Make sure the username is unique and not "admin"
2. **Business login fails:** Ensure the business has username/password set in the database
3. **Interface doesn't update:** Clear localStorage and refresh the page
4. **Password validation fails:** Ensure password is at least 6 characters

**Debug Mode:**
Set `NODE_ENV=development` to see debug information in the business form.

The authentication system is now ready for use! The system provides a secure, role-based access control that separates admin and business functionality while maintaining a simple user experience.
