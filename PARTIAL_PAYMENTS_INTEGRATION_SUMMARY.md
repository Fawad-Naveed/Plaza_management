# Partial Payments Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated partial payments into the "Rent Management" → "All Bills" section of the bill-generation component. Users can now view and manage partial payment records alongside regular rent bills.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Loading & State Management
- Added `partialPayments` state to store partial payment records
- Updated `loadBillData()` to fetch partial payments using `clientDb.getPartialPayments()`
- Added import for `PartialPayment` type from the database module

### 2. Data Filtering & Organization
- Added `filteredPartialPayments` to filter partial payments based on search terms
- Implemented `paidPartialPayments` and `unpaidPartialPayments` for status-based filtering
- Created `getCurrentPartialPayments()` function to get partial payments based on active tab (all/paid/unpaid)

### 3. UI Integration in Bills Table
- Added partial payment rows in the bill list table with purple-themed styling
- Each partial payment row displays:
  - Unique identifier: `PP-YYYY-XXX` format
  - Business name and shop number
  - Month/year information
  - Total rent amount
  - Payment status (Fully Paid/Partially Paid) with color-coded badges
  - Amount paid and remaining amount with status-specific badges
  - Creation date
  - Action buttons (View Details, Add Payment)

### 4. Updated Tab Counts & Totals
- Modified tab headers to include partial payments in counts:
  - All tab: `All (${bills + advances + partialPayments})`
  - Unpaid tab: `Unpaid (${unpaidBills + unpaidPartialPayments})`
  - Paid tab: `Paid (${paidBills + advances + paidPartialPayments})`
- Updated summary cards to include partial payments in total amounts and averages
- Updated empty state message to mention partial payments

### 5. Payment Management Functionality
- Added dialog for adding payments to existing partial payment records
- Implemented `handleAddPaymentToPartial()` function to:
  - Validate payment amounts (must be > 0 and ≤ remaining amount)
  - Create new payment entries in the `payment_entries` array
  - Update `total_paid_amount` and `status` accordingly
  - Automatically mark as "completed" when fully paid
- Added form fields for payment amount, date, and optional description

### 6. User Experience Enhancements
- Color-coded rows: Purple background for partial payment rows
- Detailed view dialog showing all payment entries and running totals
- Intuitive "Add Payment" button only appears for unpaid partial payments
- Real-time validation and feedback in the payment dialog
- Consistent styling with existing bill management UI

## Key Features

### Visual Differentiation
- Partial payments are displayed with purple-themed styling to distinguish from regular bills
- Clear badges indicate payment status and type
- Separate sections for paid amount and remaining balance

### Payment Tracking
- Complete audit trail of all partial payments made
- Running totals automatically calculated and updated
- Status automatically changes from "active" to "completed" when fully paid

### Integration with Existing Workflow
- Partial payments appear alongside regular bills and advances in the unified view
- Consistent search functionality works across all record types
- Tab filtering (All/Paid/Unpaid) includes partial payments appropriately

## Usage
1. Navigate to "Rent Management" → "All Bills"
2. Partial payment records appear with purple background and "Partial Payment" badges
3. Click the eye icon to view detailed payment history
4. Click the "+" button to add additional payments to incomplete records
5. Use the tabs to filter by payment status (All/Paid/Unpaid)
6. Search functionality works across all record types

## Database Requirements
- Ensure the `partial_payments` table exists with the proper schema
- Run the migration script if moving from the old installments system
- The component gracefully handles missing tables and shows empty state

## Next Steps
- Test the functionality with actual partial payment data
- Consider adding export/print functionality for partial payment records
- Add ability to edit or delete partial payment entries if needed
- Implement bulk payment operations for multiple partial payments
