# Floor Filter Implementation for Business Management

## Summary
Successfully added floor filtering functionality to the Business Management / View Business screen in your plaza management app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Floor Filter State
**File**: `components/customer-management.tsx`
**Location**: Line 56
```typescript
const [floorFilter, setFloorFilter] = useState("all")
```

### 2. Added Floor Filter Handler
**File**: `components/customer-management.tsx`
**Location**: Lines 618-621
```typescript
// Handle floor filter change
const handleFloorFilterChange = React.useCallback((value: string) => {
  setFloorFilter(value)
}, [])
```

### 3. Updated Business Filtering Logic
**File**: `components/customer-management.tsx`
**Location**: Lines 623-637
```typescript
const filteredBusinesses = businesses.filter(
  (business) => {
    // Search term filter
    const matchesSearchTerm = searchTerm === "" || 
      business.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
      business.phone.includes(searchTerm) ||
      business.shop_number.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
    
    // Floor filter
    const matchesFloorFilter = floorFilter === "all" || 
      business.floor_number.toString() === floorFilter
    
    return matchesSearchTerm && matchesFloorFilter
  }
)
```

### 4. Added Floor Filter Dropdown UI
**File**: `components/customer-management.tsx`
**Location**: Lines 1047-1059
```typescript
<Select value={floorFilter} onValueChange={handleFloorFilterChange}>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-40">
    <SelectValue placeholder="Filter by floor" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="all">All Floors</SelectItem>
    {floors.map((floor) => (
      <SelectItem key={floor.id} value={floor.floor_number.toString()}>
        {floor.floor_name}
      </SelectItem>
    ))}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

## How It Works

1. **Filter UI**: A dropdown appears next to the search box in the "View Business" section
2. **Floor Options**: The dropdown shows "All Floors" and lists all available floors from your floors data
3. **Combined Filtering**: The filter works together with the existing search functionality
4. **Real-time Updates**: Results update immediately when a floor is selected

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to **Business Management > View Businesses**
2. You'll see the search box and a new "Filter by floor" dropdown
3. Select any floor from the dropdown to see only businesses on that floor
4. Select "All Floors" to remove the floor filter
5. The search functionality continues to work alongside the floor filter

## Features

✅ **Real-time filtering**: Results update immediately when filter changes
✅ **Combined search**: Works together with existing search functionality
✅ **Dynamic floor list**: Automatically populated from your floors database
✅ **Clean UI**: Integrated seamlessly with existing design
✅ **Performance optimized**: Uses React.useCallback for efficient re-renders

## Testing

The implementation has been added and the development server is running at `http://localhost:3000`. 

You can test the floor filtering by:
1. Going to Business Management > View Businesses
2. Adding businesses to different floors (if not already done)
3. Using the floor filter dropdown to filter businesses by floor
4. Combining floor filtering with search terms to further refine results
