# Electricity Bill PDF Enhancement

## Overview
The electricity bill PDF generation has been enhanced to include the complete meter reading history for each business. This provides customers with a comprehensive view of their electricity consumption over time.

## Features

### Enhanced PDF Content
When generating a PDF from "Electricity Management > All Bills", the PDF now includes:

1. **Current Reading Details** (as before)
   - Previous reading
   - Current reading  
   - Units consumed
   - Rate per unit
   - Amount calculation

2. **NEW: Complete Reading History Table**
   - Shows up to last 10 readings chronologically
   - Columns: Date, Previous, Current, Units, Rate, Amount
   - Current reading is highlighted in yellow
   - Automatically paginated if history is long

3. **Historical Summary**
   - Total historical consumption (all readings combined)
   - Total historical amount
   - Note if showing partial history (when >10 readings exist)

### Key Enhancements Made

1. **Database Query Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Fetch all meter readings for the specific business
   const { data: allReadings } = await clientDb.getMeterReadings(reading.business_id)
   const businessElectricityReadings = (allReadings || [])
     .filter(r => r.meter_type === "electricity")
     .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.reading_date).getTime() - new Date(b.reading_date).getTime())
   ```

2. **Dynamic Table Generation**
   - Responsive table with proper column spacing
   - Automatic page breaks when content overflows
   - Table headers repeated on new pages
   - Current reading highlighted for easy identification

3. **Smart Pagination**
   - Checks if content exceeds page limits (250px)
   - Adds new pages automatically
   - Maintains table structure across pages

## Database Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Before this enhancement works, you must apply the database migration:

```sql
-- Add payment_status column
ALTER TABLE meter_readings ADD COLUMN payment_status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'paid', 'overdue'));

-- Add bill_number column
ALTER TABLE meter_readings ADD COLUMN bill_number VARCHAR;

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_meter_readings_payment_status ON meter_readings(payment_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_meter_readings_bill_number ON meter_readings(bill_number);
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to "Electricity Management > All Bills"
2. Find any meter reading in the table
3. Click the printer icon (🖨️) in the Actions column
4. The generated PDF will include:
   - Standard invoice header with business branding
   - Current reading details and calculation
   - Complete reading history table
   - Historical consumption summary
   - Payment status and footer

## PDF Layout Structure

```
📄 PAGE 1
├── Business Header & Logo

📄 PAGE 2+ (if needed)
