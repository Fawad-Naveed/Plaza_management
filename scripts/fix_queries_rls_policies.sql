-- Fix RLS Policies for Queries Table
-- This script adjusts the Row Level Security policies to work with the current auth system

-- First, let's temporarily disable RLS to test if that's the issue
ALTER TABLE queries DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Businesses can view own queries" ON queries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Businesses can insert own queries" ON queries; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all queries" ON queries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all queries" ON queries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete queries" ON queries;

-- For now, let's create simple policies that allow authenticated users to access queries
-- We can refine these later once we understand your auth system better

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to select queries
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view queries" 
ON queries FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to insert queries
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert queries" 
ON queries FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to update queries (for admin functionality)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update queries" 
ON queries FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy 4: Allow authenticated users to delete queries (for admin functionality)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete queries" 
ON queries FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Re-enable RLS with the new policies
ALTER TABLE queries ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test: Insert a sample query to verify the policies work
-- Note: This will only work if you're authenticated
-- Uncomment the following lines to test:
/*
INSERT INTO queries (business_id, title, description, category, priority) 
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM businesses LIMIT 1), 
  'Test Query - Policy Check', 
  'Testing if RLS policies work correctly', 
  'other', 
  'medium'
);
*/

-- Verify the policies are created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'queries';
