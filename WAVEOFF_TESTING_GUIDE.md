# Waveoff Functionality Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Completed

The waveoff functionality has been successfully implemented across all billing types:

### Updated Components:
1. **bill-generation.tsx** - Rent, Electricity & Gas bills
2. **maintenance-module.tsx** - Maintenance bills  
3. **payment-management.tsx** - All bill types in payment views
4. **database schema** - All tables updated

### Updated Database Tables:
- `bills` table (rent, electricity, gas)
- `maintenance_bills` table
- `meter_readings` table

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting: Not Seeing Waveoff Option

If you're not seeing the "Waved Off" option in the dropdown, try these steps:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Hard refresh the page
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
```

### 2. Check Browser Developer Console
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors
3. Look for any red error messages

### 3. Verify Database Changes
Run this SQL to confirm the schema was updated correctly:
```sql
SELECT constraint_name, check_clause 
FROM information_schema.check_constraints 
WHERE constraint_name IN ('bills_status_check', 'maintenance_bills_status_check', 'meter_readings_payment_status_check');
```

### 4. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 5. Check Component Loading
Navigate to different sections:
- **Rent Management** → "All Bills" tab
- **Electricity Management** → "All Bills" tab  
- **Gas Management** → "All Bills" tab
- **Maintenance Management** → Bill list
- **Payment Management** → Unpaid Bills / Paid Bills

## ✅ How to Test Waveoff

### For Rent Bills:
1. Go to **Rent Management** → **All Bills**
2. Find any bill with "Paid" or "Unpaid" status
3. Click the status dropdown
4. You should see: **Unpaid**, **Paid**, **Waved Off**
5. Select "Waved Off"
6. The status should update and show a blue badge

### For Electricity/Gas Bills:
1. Go to **Electricity Management** → **All Bills**
2. Look for both regular bills and meter readings
3. Both should have the waveoff option in status dropdowns

### For Maintenance Bills:
1. Go to **Maintenance Management**
2. Find any maintenance bill
3. Click the status badge dropdown
4. Select "Waved Off" option

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Status changes to "Waved Off"
- ✅ Blue badge appears
- ✅ Database is updated
- ✅ Changes persist after page refresh

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Network Tab**: See if API calls are failing
2. **Verify User Role**: Ensure you're logged in as an admin
3. **Database Connection**: Confirm database is accessible
4. **Component Re-render**: Try switching between different management sections

The implementation is complete and should work across all billing types!
